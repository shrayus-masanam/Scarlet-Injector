# Scarlet Injector
Normally, [Scarlet](https://usescarlet.com) only lets you inject one tweak into an app through the installation process. This program creates a simple Scarlet JSON repo that will let you inject as many tweaks as you want into an IPA with Scarlet. The repo houses the user-supplied IPA's download URL along with the URLs of all dylib/deb files that the user specifies. The JSON data is uploaded to [Ghostbin](https://paste.bingner.com) and will persist for 14 days. Once the app is installed onto the device, the repo can be safely removed and the app will stay installed & refresh/resign when needed.
